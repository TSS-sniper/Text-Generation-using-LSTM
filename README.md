# Text Generation using LSTM
## Introduction:
* This project aims to generate relevant text from user-given seed text using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) algorithm. 
* This model is trained upon a given corpus of text data to learn patterns, grammar, and contextual relationships. 
* This model can generate coherent and contextually relevant text, reflecting the Text Corpus it was trained on.
## Methodology:
The following steps ensure coherent and contextually relevant text generation:
1. Loading the data. 
2. Preprocessing the data and Tokenizing.
3. Building and fitting the model on data.
4. Evaluating the model.
5. Predicting i.e.Generating the text and Iterate on the process.
